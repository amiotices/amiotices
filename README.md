Hello, we are My
With extensive experience in the crypto market in the security field, our team has extensive experience in writing secure smart contracts.

We audit and develop smart contracts with the aim of improving writing quality, checking security, and protecting smart contracts from hackers like BSC, ETH, Matic, KuCoin, and more.

Security can be an important issue for distributed application developers. That's why we implemented a service called DApp Security.

Smart contract code auditing is an important first step in securing distributed applications and is not enough to guarantee the security of DApps. Smart contract auditing covers only one layer of the blockchain ecosystem, completely ignoring external applications with which the contract may interact. This means that they are severely underrepresented in assessing the true vulnerabilities of DApps.

An accurate DApp security assessment requires comprehensive penetration testing and smart contract audits. This enables auditors to identify all potential attack vectors against distributed applications, not just those visible in the DApp's smart contract backend code.

That's why we implemented a service called DApp Security. We manually check for all of these vulnerabilities and more, and use automated analysis tools to ensure the integrity of your application. You can contact us for more information on pricing. We also provide KYC/Doxx services.
